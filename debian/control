Description: Daemon for PS3 Bluetooth Controllers
 This package provides the modules (called 'sixad') for connecting PS3 hardware
 (Sixaxis/DualShock3 and Keypads) to a Linux-compatible machine
 .
 Currently sixad supports:
  - Sixaxis buttons, axis, accelerometers and LEDs
  - PS3 Keypads
 .
 sixad also registers the Sixaxis and Keypad's MAC/ID in the joystick name
 (ex: "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller (00:XX:X0:0X:XX)".
